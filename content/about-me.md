# A Brief History of Me

Technology enthusiast, I am interested in electronics and IT since I was 14 years old. After searching my way through mechanics, then electronic engineering. I ended up at Epitech (an IT french school) in order to obtain my master degree. Now, I am working full time as a Freelance developer.

# Freelancing

Freelance since June 2017. I Have started my own company and consulting clients needing experienced manpower in order to fast track their project, with medium to long term missions.

Working mainly with NodeJS and various backend frameworks, I also worked with C, C++.

## Career Aspiration

After 5 years of Full-stack / Backend development, I aspire to become a software architect. Interested in new technologies and programming languages, I try to take good practices from each of them in order to craft a long-lasting and maintainable solution for my clients.


### New Toys
Since the beginning of 2019, I started learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and it is now my language of choice for my pet projects. Its reliability and stability when compiled make it a great weapon. Still not fully featured yet, I use it mainly for CLI tools I develop in order to automate redundant tasks.

# Past experiences

## Delair
I am currently working for [Delair](https://delair.aero/), a company that builds drone and processes images to provide valuable insight to its customers.
As a Backend engineer, I am helping the teams build and ship micro-services written in Python / NodeJS or CPP. Mainly on the development side, I contribute to the system's architecture as well.

Delair's platform is a mix of legacy and brand new services, communicating through HTTP or message queues. In 2019 Delair's challenge will be to merge its platform with Red Bird's, acquired at the end of last year.

## Dating App
Not allowed to disclose its name, this mobile dating app is supposed to match people, approximately the same way as [once](https://getonce.com/en) does.
I built their Backend MVP (a simple REST API), written in NodeJS using Express.
Nothing fancy but it gets the job done.

## Oneflow
My most valuable experience so far. [Oneflow](http://www.oneflowsystems.com/) has been an incredible company, disrupting the print industry with the advent of digital presses. They offer an API to fast forward orders through the production and shipping line.

Working as a Full-stack developer, I developed UI components in Angular 1.0 or API services in NodeJS / Express.

I also developed an automated end to end test running in our CI/CD pipeline. This improved our confidence and deployment time.
Production deployment occurred once or twice a week.
